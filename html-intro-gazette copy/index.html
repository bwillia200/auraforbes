<!-- #Re edit with entertaintment content
#Make sure links back links to posts
#Add images and follow the Procedure Down bellow

1.index.html will be the homepage. It should have the title of the newspaper (The New York Code + Design Academy Gazette) in popping as font

2.The homepage should also have the titles of each post, as well as an excerpt and a link to that post. The link would look like <a href="post1.html">Read More</a> for example. That way when you click one it loads up the correct post page.
3. Add an image to each post and excerpt too; you can resize an image if it's too big by using height and width attributes <img height="200" src="something.png" />

4.Each post file should have a unique title and a link to go back to index.html. The content for the posts can be placeholder text from hipster ipsum or bacon ipsum. Don't forget to include the image you picked in each post. -->
