<p> Well, amidst plenty of turmoil and drama between Nickelodeon stars (see: Josh Peck didn't invite Drake Bell to his wedding), it's nice to finally see a heartwarming headline. </p>

<p> It seems that over the weekend there was a bit of a mini-reunion between two Nickelodeon legends Josh Peck of Drake and Josh and Victoria Justice of Victorious.
